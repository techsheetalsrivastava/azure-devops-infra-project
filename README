DevOps End-to-End Deployment Project ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow, covering application containerization, CI/CD automation, and deployment on a cloud-hosted Virtual Machine. It showcases how modern DevOps practices can be applied to take an application from source code to production.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights

Source Control (Git & GitHub) â€“ Version-controlled application with structured commits and GitHub repository.

Dockerization â€“ Packaged the application into a portable Docker image for consistent runtime.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions â€“ Automated pipeline to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub on every push to main.

Container Deployment on VM â€“ Pulled the Docker image and deployed the application inside a container on a Linux-based Virtual Machine.

Secure Authentication â€“ Configured GitHub SSH keys for secure repository access and Docker Hub credentials via GitHub Secrets.

Browser Access â€“ Verified application accessibility over the assigned VM port (e.g., http://<vm-ip>:3000).

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Version Control: Git, GitHub

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Containerization: Docker & Docker Hub

Infrastructure: Cloud Virtual Machine (Linux)

Security: GitHub Secrets, SSH Authentication

ðŸ”¹ Project Flow

Clone the repository and initialize Git.

Dockerize the application with a Dockerfile.

Configure GitHub Actions for automated builds and image push.

Pull and run the Docker container on a cloud VM.

Expose container ports for browser-based access.

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes

Fully automated pipeline from commit â†’ build â†’ push â†’ deploy.

Containerized application accessible in a browser.

Secure integration between GitHub and Docker Hub.
